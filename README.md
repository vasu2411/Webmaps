# Webmaps

It is a python application developed using pandas and folium libraries.

This application takes some data from Valcanoes.txt and world.json files and shows that data on map using marker layer and polygon layer. Here, I used marker layer to show valcanoes data and polygon layer to show world population data. Lastly, I added layer control to see individual layers as well.

For this, You have to install pandas and folium libraries (If you haven't installed it before).

Use below commands:

1. pip install pandas
2. pip install folium
